## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Retrieval parameter configuration
The system SHALL keep `TOP_K_RETRIEVAL` and `TOP_K_RERANK` configurable via environment variables in `src/config/settings.py`, defaulting to 10 and 5 respectively.

The system SHALL support overriding these values at evaluation time without modifying source code.

#### Scenario: Parameter override via environment
- **WHEN** user sets `TOP_K_RETRIEVAL=15` and `TOP_K_RERANK=8` in `.env`
- **THEN** the RAG pipeline SHALL use 15 initial retrieval results and keep 8 after reranking

### Requirement: Short query handling
The system SHALL handle short queries (under 5 Chinese characters) gracefully by:
- Returning a fallback response indicating the query is too short
- Not performing an empty or meaningless vector search

#### Scenario: Short query returns guidance
- **WHEN** user sends a query of fewer than 5 Chinese characters (e.g., "你好", "是的")
- **THEN** the system SHALL respond with a message suggesting a more specific financial question

### Requirement: Cross-document aggregation
When a query requires information spread across multiple chunks from different documents within the same KB, the RAG chain SHALL aggregate context from up to TOP_K_RERANK chunks regardless of which document they originate from.

#### Scenario: Cross-document query returns aggregated results
- **WHEN** user asks a question whose answer spans multiple documents in the same KB
- **THEN** the response SHALL include information from all relevant documents, with citations tracing back to each source document

### Requirement: Retrieval quality comparison
The system SHALL provide a CLI command to compare retrieval quality across different parameter combinations:
- TOP_K_RETRIEVAL: 5, 10, 15
- TOP_K_RERANK: 3, 5, 8

Results SHALL include average relevance score and recall@K metrics per combination.

#### Scenario: Retrieval comparison report
- **WHEN** user runs retrieval comparison CLI
- **THEN** a comparison table SHALL be printed showing metrics per parameter combination
